Tellurian language is going to be a simplified treatment - i.e. not as extensive and original as Medalian. For the most part, there are two branches: 

1. An English-like "western" branch
2. A "Chinese/Japanese"-like "eastern" branch

Features from other many Earthling languages will be referenced and even *directly borrowed*. Lots of words in this case are **translation**, **localization** or **transliteration** of the underlying meaning we are trying to build.

In the most wild scenarios - we may in fact borrow all Earthling languages directly as is: specifically, Chinese and English. However, we must do extensive studies and modifications to **make things suit our setting**.

# Adoption - Chinese

* The Chinese language can be adopted completed, and we assume the following features: 1) Traditional chinese letters; 2) Bopomofo (TaiWan) ransliteration system; 3) Lots of use of 文言用法, 3) Word changes and usage changes in modernized versions.

# Adoption - English

* See [Earthling Language Changes](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Project-Nine/TellurianLanguage/blob/main/Studies/Earthling%20Language%20Changes.md) for adoption and changes.
