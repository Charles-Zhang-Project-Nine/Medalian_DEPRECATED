* Numerical encoded
* Single glyph
* Compound single glyph
* Not pronounciable - separate mapping existing from Medalian culture.
* Written in romanization: e.g. either "NBK" or "N+B+K", and it can be either made into a single word "(NBK)" or a compound of when each letter actually mean something: "N (Novus)" + "B (venari/simulation)" + "K(Club)". The single english letter can be taken from Medalian transliteration; Generally recomment pure-abbreviation style writing and all sorts of two-to-three letter combinations, e.g. "A", "Np" (for two letters, lowercase second letter), "NAN".
